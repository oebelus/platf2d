        There is an infinite number of levels, and thus, 
        the score will be infinite as well. <br><br>In each level, there will be a random number of coins,
        that you should find a way to gather. And if gathering them all is impossible, then, refresh
        the page and start again, with probably, a better luck in coins' positions? <br><br>After gathering all the coins 
        of the level - good luck with this-, a door will be displayed, maybe, a door to a better random distribution of platforms? 
        What if the door itself isn't accessible? Who knows... <br><hr><span>And the game loop continues...</span>
